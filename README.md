# ðŸš€ Kone Ci/Cd Blueprint Framework â€“ Platform Engineering POC

This repo demonstrates a **dynamic, GitHub Actions-based CI/CD framework** that generates pipelines automatically from a centralized configuration (`.ci-blueprint.yaml`). It supports multiple tech stacks and deployment methods via a shared, modular template strategy.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

Build a **standardized and extensible CI/CD system** that:

- âœ… Supports **multiple tech stacks** (Python, Node, Java, etc.)
- âœ… Handles different **build tools** (pip, npm, Maven, etc.)
- âœ… Dynamically creates stages based on a config file
- âœ… Applies consistent **branching/tagging rules**
- âœ… Is easy to **extend**, maintain, and scale across teams
